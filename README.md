# (WIP) Rock Paper Scissors
A small Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in Python.
My main goal with this is to practice striking the balance between cleanliness, straightfowardness and scalability.


## Current observations:
+ Currently, it is run via CLI only. A GUI version should be implemented in the future
+ Bot choices are completely random, leading to things such as frequent repetitions and lack of consideration of user choice patterns. A proper bot choice system should be implemented in the future
